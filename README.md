# CrystalConflict
### My first (self-made) 2D turn-based survival game
This game was originally based on a Unity tutorial named Roguelike 2D. However, almost every aspect is adjusted to make it suitable for this game. The most significant change is the hexagonal board, for which I used my crystallographic knowledge. This is also why the game is called Crystal Conflict and why I added the collectible / harvestable crystals.
